# Thingular

## Background

Thingular is my idea for a startup competition. Thingular is facebook for products - it allows people to share their things with people they want. 

## To Use

The app used Google firebase for authentication and database. To use the app, you will need to create a firebase project and add the `firebaseConfig` in `lib/firebase.js`.
